# SpeedOmeter V2
## Developer - JuaIMS [@github](https://github.com/JuaIMS)

As the title says.
This project is all about a speedometer(for my bicycle). 

The project is coded in Arduino IDE, Nothing fancy. The code is made very crudely.
I have not commented anything (besides some basic things).
The main purpose of this project was that I was unable to find any speedometer related
project that suited my purpose, hence I wrote it myself. The code isn't very complicated,
it should be understandable without comments anyway.

Just for my own reference, I have hosted it on github (and for memories too üòÅ).
I have no plan to make this repo public ~~(as of now)~~.

Libraries used :-
  ```U8G2LIB```

**Edit - As of 5 feb 24, this repo is public.**
