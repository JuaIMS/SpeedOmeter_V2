# SpeedOmeter V2
## Developer - JuaIMS [@github](https://github.com/JuaIMS/SpeedOmeter_V2)

As the title says.
This project is all about a speedometer(for my cycle).

Just for my own reference, I have hosted it on github (and for memories too üòÅ).
I have no plan to make this repo public (as of now).
## Images of the hardware.
Just in case if I lost the hardware, I want to have it as a memory.
